## Unofficial LOS 17.1 GSI Builds for FP3 ##

This repo includes the build script for the PHH-based LineageOS 17.1 GSIs targeting the Fairphone FP3. Personal builds and OTA updates are being made using this script on a regular basis; they are available at [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fwg-cag-fp3gsi/files/lineage-17.1/) with installation instructions but without any guarantee and support. For further details about the script itself and its usage have a look at [Andy Yan's original GSI build script](https://github.com/AndyCGYan/treble_build_los) and at [PPH's "How to build a GSI"](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki/How-to-build-a-GSI%3F); here, the possibility to set an OTA_UPDATES link and an OTA_DEVICE target has been added.

I welcome you reporting [issues](https://github.com/fwg-cag/treble_build_los/issues) above regarding both, the script but also the builds at [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fwg-cag-fp3gsi/files/lineage-17.1/). However, I'm not in a position to guarantee you any support or quick resolution.
